    <h1>Some Tips (You probably have known these, but let's take a look whatever...)</h1>
    <div class="input_tips">
        <p id="tip_one">
            1. The alphabetical input is case-insensitive. So, it means the same thing if you put aah or AAH in course prefix,
            and it is also the same case when you input professor.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="tip_two">
            2. When you input the course number, please follow the three-digit format: for example, if you would like query for
            CSC 103, then please put 103 in the course number text box.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="tip_three">
            3. Please only input the first name or the last name of the professor.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="tip_four">
            4. If you are not sure about the course prefix or course number to input, please refer to Union's
            <a href="https://catalog.union.edu/content.php?catoid=21&navoid=883">course listing</a> to search via the
            Keyword or Phrase feature; if you have any question about the spelling of professor's name, you can try to
            search on the <a href="https://webapps.union.edu/directory">directory</a> by using the Search or Department
            feature.
        </p>
        <p id="tip_five">
            5. After you have confirmed the course that you want to inquire, please hit Suggest. It might take a while
            to redirect, depending on the quality of Internet connection.
        </p>
        <p id="tip_six">
            6. Since we are still
            developing the catalog, please feel free to leave any comments in the text box at the bottom of the inquired
            page. Thanks!<br>
